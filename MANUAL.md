## Posts

### General informations
Posts are the heart of **Circuit**. It is the way you communicate with other users. There are some more options besides posting 256 characters of pure text. You can further answer to people, repost things, mention users or use hashtags.

With the help of our functions you can easily group information contained in your post and group for whom should it be.

### Hashtags
Hashtags are the best way to keep information centralized. If you want to highlight some information about your post, you just need to write a # followed by alphanumeric characters, and we'll do the rest!

You can look for all the posts that include that hashtag. To do that, just click on the hashtag you want or in the search field type # and the hashtag name you want to search for.

### Mentions
Mentions is one of the ways you can interact with people. You can let someone know that you want their attention if you write their username with a @ before it and he will get notified that you have mentioned him.

### Repost
You liked a post of another user? You liked it so much that you want to share it to your feed without stealing it? Just repost it! The reposts are really useful when you find a post that you would like to share with other people without writing it yourself!

### Favorite
You liked a post so much that you would like to have a quick access to it? Well that's what the **favorite** option is for! Just favorite a post, and keep an eye on it once in a while!

Once you've favorited you can quickly access to them from your profile!

## Circles
The circles are our way to keep the visibility of your posts as you want to! We have two standard circles: `Public` and `Me`. As their name say, they are for either everyone visible or just for you. But that's not everything, you can create your own circles, edit them, and, if you don't want them anymore, you can delete them!

### Add people to your circles
There are two ways of doing this. 

- 1. You can go directly to the profile of the user you want to follow and add them to the circle you would want to. The user will get a notification, when you add him to it. 
- 2. You can add people while you are editing your circle or creating one. Just type the name of the person you want, select the one you mean and click on save! _Done!_

### Create a circle
To create a circle all you have to do is:

1. Go to your profile.
2. Click on `Manage circles`.
3. Write a name for the circle.
4. Add people to it, writing their names and then select the person you mean.
5. Click on `Save`.

Done! You have another circle!

### Edit your own circle
To edit any circle you have created, follow the next steps:

1. Go to your profile.
2. Click on `Manage circles`.
3. Look up for your circle.
4. Click on the pencil icon.
5. Edit want you want to (Name of the circle or people in it).
6. Click on `Save`.

Done! The circle has been edited!

### Delete a circle
To delete one of your circles, it's very easy! Just follow the next steps:

1. Go to your profile.
2. Click on `Manage circles`.
3. Look up for your circle.
4. Click on the trash icon.
5. Confirm the action.

_Pfft!_ Circle gone!

    This cannot be reversed, once you've deleted a circle, you cannot go back in time!

### API
Do you want to connect with us from an external client? That's cool! We offer two possibilities to do that, via JSON and via HTML. Both of them are made considering the REST architecture styles.

#### JSON API
Do you want to handle the info yourself? We are cool with that and we offer you an API that will always give you a JSON response.

##### General
If you want to see the information everytime without having to come here and read it again, we have made a general overview JSON Response where you can either look it up on our site or just send a request to

[http://127.0.0.1/api/](http://127.0.0.1/api/)
    
and it will return what you can do.

##### Login
To login you have to send a GET request to

[http://127.0.0.1/api/login/](http://127.0.0.1/api/login/)
    
get the field names and send back a POST request with the required fields. You will get a **Token**, *without it you won't get further*.

##### Send a post
To send a post you need to include in the header the given token as

    Authorization: Token <<put_your_token_here>>
    
You will need as well a post content, an image file or None if you don't want to upload one and **very important** a circle id. We will give you obviously which are the available circles that you can choose.

[http://127.0.0.1/api/login/](http://127.0.0.1/api/login/)
    
as a form request and you'll get a form! With which all the required info will be sent.

##### Login
After you send the first request, you'll get a form with a Log in form, fill the spaces and send the next request!

##### Send a post
All you've got to do is write the information, select your circle and **ba-dam-pts** your post was sent!
